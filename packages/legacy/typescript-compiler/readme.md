# Legacy Transpiler

I started work on this typescript-based transpiler before making the decision to switch over to rust and use PEGs instead of writing all of the lexical and syntatical parsing by hand.

Currently all it includes is the lexer, and is a legacy package in this repo, but I think the lexing code is actually kinda cool so I'm gonna keep it as a package in the monorepo.
